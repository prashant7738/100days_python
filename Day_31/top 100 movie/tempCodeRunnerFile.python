doc.add_heading('1.2 Definition of Resistance Welding', level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Resistance welding is a process where heat is generated through the electrical resistance between two metal surfaces. "
    "This heat, combined with mechanical pressure, forms a solid-state weld. First developed in the early 20th century, "
    "resistance welding has evolved significantly, becoming a critical technology in industrial applications for its speed and precision."

doc.add_heading('1.3 Purpose and Scope of the Report', level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "This report provides an in-depth analysis of resistance welding, covering its principles, types, equipment, applications, and benefits. "
    "The focus is on understanding the workings of resistance welding, its various forms, and its practical applications across different industries."
)

doc.add_heading('2. Principles of Resistance Welding', level=1)

doc.add_paragraph(
    "Resistance welding operates on the principle of heat generation through electrical resistance. When an electric current passes through metal workpieces, "
    "resistance at the contact points generates heat. This localized heating, combined with the application of pressure, causes the metal to melt and fuse, forming a weld. "
    "Essential components of this process include electrodes, which apply pressure and conduct the current, and the workpieces being joined."
)

doc.add_heading('2.1 Types of Resistance Welding', level=2)

doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Spot Welding: Commonly used in the automotive industry, spot welding involves applying a localized current to small spots on metal sheets to create welds at specific points, "
    "ideal for joining overlapping sheets."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Seam Welding: Similar to spot welding, but with continuous current, seam welding creates a leak-proof joint along the edges of metal sheets. "
    "Itâ€™s commonly used in can and tank production."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Projection Welding: This method creates localized welds at specific projections or raised areas on the metal surface, often used for welding components with complex shapes."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Flash Welding: Using high current and pressure, flash welding is ideal for joining large sections or dissimilar metals."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Upset Welding: This method generates heat through resistance while pressing metals together, commonly used for welding rods and bars in the manufacture of fasteners and bolts."
